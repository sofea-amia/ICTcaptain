    <h1>Sofea's ICT captain letter</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Super tech savvy <br> Organised <br> Fair <br> Enthusiastic <br> Adventurous
    </p>

    <p>I have always had a passion for ICT, I feel happy when I have a keyboard in reach and a mouse in my hand, looking at a screen and playing with the computer's settings. My science projects for school have always been about computer science, and when
      people say "Your project is just fun, there's no science!", I would explain to them that it was computer science (the best science in the world). I also believe ICT to be more of use than paper because it is way easier to print a letter by pressing
      a button than draw a circle and then maybe a linefollowing that circle, ICT is way more practical. </p>
    <h2>Why should I be captain?</h2>
    <p>I have a HUGE passion for ICT, which is what the ICT captain needs because if someone doesn't like what they're doing, even if they are good at it, at the end of the day it all depends on passion "Do what you love, and sucsess comes with it". I'm
      also surrounded by ICT people aswell, because my mom was an electrical engineer and my dad is a software engineer, and they have taught me loads about ICT so my experience is great. I also have the three main keys of being a captain and they are
      organisation, confidence, and persistence. I always hand in my homework prior to the due date, I have grown my confidence from hiding from my audience to basically making fun of myself! And I have also learnt that in captaincy, trial and error come
      to play and persistence is key. I also have some qualities that come in real handy when working in the ICT area. One of them is that I know html ,which is how I built this website myself, and a bit of python. </p>

    <p>Another one is that, I love to play around with settings, press a few buttons, turn a few knobs, basically expiriment with the computer and most of the time I can figure out how the computer or machine works!</p>
    <h2> What can I bring to the school? </h2>
    <p>With my ICT skills, I can figure out how to use the speaker for assemblies so I can help out every Monday for assembly. I also have some great ICT ideas for the school. One of them is to make a whole school project like a movie. Another one of my
      ideas is a programmer's club, an auditioned group where you have to know at least a bit of a programming language. In the programmer's club, we share knowledge on what we know, and then we are given problems to solve with code. Out side of the school
      sessions, we can also have an edmodo group or a <a href="https://github.com"> github</a> group where we can chat about it outside of school. I also thought there should be an 'ICT week' just like there is cultural diversity week and science week.
      In ICT week we show case all that we have done in the field of ICT, such as the prgrammer's club, the whole school movie, maybe some some of the film making classes short films, and maybe we can also get computer scientist, and software engineers
      to come to our school and make a speech about ICT. On that week, we can also have a computer competition, where we have to design our own computers and from each class there shall be one person voted for based on detail, creativity and usefulness,
      and then from the year level and then one person from each year level shall come to an assembly and will be voted for.</p>
